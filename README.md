# Fruits-Classification-using-Deep-Learning
Image identification/classification technology increasingly permeates various as- 5
pects of life and industry. This paper utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 6
to classify fruit images, addressing the challenges and typical process of image iden- 7
tification. The model developed and trained demonstrates high accuracy across a 8
comprehensive dataset of diverse fruit images, underscoring its robustness and ap- 9
plicability. The effectiveness of the CNN model is systematically evaluated, affirming 10
that our model is well-developed and trained. This study also lays the foundation 11
for future enhancements in the precision and capability of identifying more complex 12
items, showcasing the practical learning outcomes from this educational project.
